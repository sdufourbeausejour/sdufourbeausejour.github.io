Fun week seeing friends and colleagues from Université Laval's [Sentinel North][SN] program. Their annual meeting was at the beautifully restored Manège millitaire in Québec City. Congrats to my good friends [Jean-Gabriel Young][JG] and [Catherine Girard][CG] for their talks on network science and virus monitoring in the Arctic!
