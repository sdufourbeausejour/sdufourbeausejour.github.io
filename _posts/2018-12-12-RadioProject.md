Earlier this week at ArcticNet I presented with Valérie Plante Lévesque on the Radio Project we did together in Kangiqsujuaq, Nunavik.

In the 2017-2018 school year, a radio activity was done with a secondary 3-4-5 english class on the land and climate change. Students prepared questions with their teacher, and then recorded themselves discussing the importance of the land for them and answering each other’s questions. Parents gave their consent for the recordings to be played on the radio. After editing, segments from the discussion were aired on [CBC Radio One][CBC] in Québec city (Breakaway, May 28th 2018) and [CKIA FM 88,3][CKIA] (Voix autochtone, April 9th 2018). The podcasts for these two radio events are still online (links below), and the students listened to them with their teacher. We played a version of these podcasts at ArcticNet, to further amplify youth’s voices.

This outreach work was made possible by the [W. Garfield Weston Foundation][WGW] as well as Raglan Mine who organize their Environmental Forum in Kangiqsujuaq every year, providing an opportunity to their research partners such as myself to be present in the community and do activities such as these.
