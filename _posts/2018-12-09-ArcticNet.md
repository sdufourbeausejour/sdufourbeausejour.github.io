This year went by so quickly! Nothing says the holidays like the [ArcticNet Annual Meeting][ASM2018]. I'm very excited to co-chair session KM08. Science Education, Outreach and Communication in the North by Early Career Researchers, happening on Tuesday the 11th from 3h30 to 5 PM in room 212. [Gwyneth MacMillan][GMAC], [Catherine Girard][CG] and myself will have the pleasure of introducing our peers doing inspiring work on outreach. I'll be taking a little break from co-chairing to present the [Radio Project][Radio-Project] with Valérie Plante Lévesque. Busy day!

Remote-sensing-wise, I'll be presenting on my work using TerraSAR-X time-series to monitor snow on sea ice in Deception Bay, Nunavik. This is in session TECH02 at 13h45 in room 204. I'll also have a poster under the same title: "TerraSAR-X and time-lapse photography for snow on sea-ice monitoring in Deception Bay, Nunavik".

See you in Ottawa!
