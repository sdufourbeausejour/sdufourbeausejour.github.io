I was in Kangiqsujuaq all week with others from the [Ice Monitoring project][Ice-monitoring] as well as fellow researchers both from the [Nunavik Research Center][NRC] and [Caribou Ungava][CU]. We were there to present our latest results to community members, as part of Raglan Mine's Environmental Forum.

I brought along postcard-style leaflets with snow and ice thickness ranges measured in the last years of the project. They were pretty popular, will redo in the future!
