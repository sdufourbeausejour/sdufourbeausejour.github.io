I'm headed to Sherbrooke tonight to participate in [Women in Physics Canada 2018][WIPC]. On point physicists and feminists Sophie Rochette, Maude Lizaire and Marie-Ève Boulanger asked me to preside over the program's Diversity Afternoon which will be Wednesday July 18th and also host the following diversity panel. It's hard to say no when inspiring women ask you to participate in their awesome event!

It'll be my first time back to Sherbrooke since graduating from my master's in Physics years back. I look forward to seeing how the department has evolved.

Plan:
- eat a <i>poutine forestière</i> at the downtown <b>Snack</b>
- get some writing done at the <b>Kaàpeh</b> coffee shop just below my old apartment, if it still exists
- fangirl on <b>Emma McKay</b> during her Thursday workshop [Feminist Physics, Feminist Physicists][mckay]

Here's a picture of the organizing committee with the Honourable Kirsty Duncan, taken from the even't Facebook page.
