Only a day after getting home from [ArcticNet 2018][ASM], I was packing up my bags again to settle into the [Monastère des Augustines][mon] for the [Complex Networks Winter Workshop][CNWW]. Say what?

My strategy to survive in academia involves saying yes to everything that motivates or intrigues me. Without encouraging others to do the same, I will say that this strategy has served me well in terms of mental health. So when my good friend [Jean-Gabriel Young][JGY] told me his peers [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne][LHD] and [Antoine Allard][AA] were hosting a northern-themed workshop on complex networks sciences in Québec city, I immediately signed up.

The workshop started with two days of classes on complex systems, network science, and their combination. Faculty included [Elspeth Ready][ER], who presented her work on [food sharing networks in Kangiqsujuaq][food], as well as experts from network hubs University of Vermont and Northeastern University

Some takeaways from Elspeth's talk:

We spent the rest of the week trying to hack together a network science model for the spread of corruption. Loved working with my "Power to Corrupt" team: Oscar Granados (Finance), Ana M. Martín González (Ecology), Blanche Saint-Béat (Ecology, Northern Studies), Melody K. Schiaffino (Public Health), and Guillaume St-Onge (Physics).
