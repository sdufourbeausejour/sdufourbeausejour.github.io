This week I was in Kangiqsujuaq (Wakeham Bay) for the 2017 Raglan Mine Environmental Forum. The mine was there to present the results of their environmental monitoring and to answer questions from the public. Scientists working on projects in collaboration with Raglan, such as myself, were also there to present our work and results.

Véronique ([KRG][KRG]) and I ([Université INRS][MB]) were there for the [Ice montoring project][Ice-monitoring].

It was the first time I could see the bay without ice on it; I usually go during the winter. Even though we were only there for three busy days, it felt like a vacation. Such a beautiful place ! I feel very privileged.

Amidst all the activities surrounding the Forum, I managed to go say "hi" to the older science class and spend a whole period doing the Ice Mission workshop with the younger high school science class. In April 2018, all the students from the high school will be invited out on the ice to see first-hand what type of work we do and what type of equipment we use.

I also had time to spend two periods with Torie Kopp's english class, where we worked on an audio / radio project with the students. First part : students record themselves talking about the land and add some sounds recorded outside using the open source editing software [Audacity][Audacity]. The resources I'm preparing for this are available on Google drive [here][Audio-project]. Keep in touch if you want more info !
