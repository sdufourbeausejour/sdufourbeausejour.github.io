Just back from a two-days intensive writing retreat in Montreal with friends from the [Intercultural Indigenous Workshop][IIW]. We're getting together to write a professional experience paper about the workshop. We hope that sharing our experience may help other early-career researchers organize similar events to train themselves and their peers to do better research in a northern indigenous context. Marianne ([@Marianne_Fa][twitter-marianne]) and Gwyneth ([@gwynmac][twitter-gwyneth]) tweeted about it; check out our sweet highlighting setup!

Tips: we were very confortably installed in [Café Perko][cafe-perko]'s annex and GMAC pointed to towards this interesting Prezi titled [«Write that journal article in 7 days»][prezi].
