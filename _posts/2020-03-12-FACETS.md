Happy publication day! New paper out now [Our practice of outreach during the Ice Monitoring project in Nunavik: an early-career researcher perspective][paper].

<blockquote cite="https://medium.com/facets/learning-to-do-better-a-student-perspective-on-scientific-outreach-in-northern-indigenous-4ed99ef14c6e">
During the “Ice Monitoring in Salluit, Deception Bay, and Kangiqsujuaq” research project in Nunavik, Quebec, we spent as much time designing outreach activities as we did preparing for our fieldwork, even though time for outreach was very limited.
After our fieldwork ended, we felt the need to share our experience of participating in science communication activities.
Mainstream approaches to scientific research are colonial in nature and have historically contributed to the oppression of Indigenous peoples.
