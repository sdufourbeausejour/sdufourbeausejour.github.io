I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at [Université Laval][UL] in Québec city in 2012. I then moved on to [Université de Sherbrooke][UdeS] for my master's degree, studying high-temperature superconductors. After graduating in 2015, I became a PhD candidate at [Université INRS][INRS]. My research is at the intersection of radar remote sensing and northern studies..
