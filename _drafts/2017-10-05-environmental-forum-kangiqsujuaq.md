This week I was in Kangiqsujuaq (Wakeham Bay) for the 2017 Raglan Mine Environmental Forum. The mine was there to present the results of their environmental monitoring and to answer questions from the public. Scientists working on projects in collaboration with Raglan, such as myself, were also there to present our work and results.

Véronique ([KRG][KRG]) and I ([Université INRS][MB]) were there for the [Ice montoring project][Ice-monitoring].

It was the first time I could see the bay without ice on it; I usually go during the winter. Even though we were only there for three busy days, it felt like a vacation. Such a beautiful place ! I feel very privileged.
